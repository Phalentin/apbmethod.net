# EOPair: Inserting the Pair and Solving EO at the Same Time
EOPair is an algirithm set for inserting the back-right pair while orienting the edges at the same time. It is divided into four subsets, two with the pair in the U-layer, two with the pair in the R-layer. For both of these positions, there are algorithms for an oriented and a misoriented pair. EOPair used to be part of standard APB. At some point, solvers realized that it only saved about 0.3 moves on average while it consists of 128 algorithms. This trade-off is not worth it in most cases. It is rather recommended to learn the most efficient solutions for all the possible pair cases. If you still want to learn EOPair, it is recommended you start with the misoriented U subset.

The algorithms can be found in the [regular EO algorithm sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hs9ikHz-4cfbqBfqvuvE8X9sjCb4Jtm482ZvsFQA2rY/edit?gid=1684874333).

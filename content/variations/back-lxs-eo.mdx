# Back Slot LXS & Edge Orientation
Instead of solving the BR pair and then doing LXS and EO on the dfR pieces, you can solve the FR pair and then do LXS and EO on the dbR pieces. This has the obvious disatvantages of having to learn 127 new EO and LXS algorithms and more blind spots. It can still be worth it on some scrambles that have a very easy or solved FR pair after completing the 2x2x3.

## Algorithms
  
### Pair Solving
- [Pair Solving](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1nwq_-HLeDgajuAOVRaH2Jo7X9zSTEBrnIRSv3hzeg/) by Liam Highducheck
- [Pair Solving](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Agu9KUs99H2CHI_cEkkmSmwtTWMX6tjQ/) by Kombofuud
  
### Edge Orientation
- [Edge Orientation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hs9ikHz-4cfbqBfqvuvE8X9sjCb4Jtm482ZvsFQA2rY/) by Athefre

Note that for Standard APB you only need to learn the algorithms in the *dBR Solved EO* tab.

### LXS
- [LXS](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/) by Athefre
- [LXS patterns for learning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACKQXpMK0b8RWGoN9wMDbnF-W-S4mMdeJH5IcjeEyf8/) by Liam Highducheck
  
### ZBLL
- [SpeedCubeDB ZBLL](https://speedcubedb.com/a/ZBLL): big selection of algorithms, but the top algorithm is often not the best one
- [Teri's ZBLL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BiQZkCZvTDRlW6Y6jTBHXPPjZF9k55x8YJgXXs5nhCs/): really optimised algorithms, but getting the right fingertricks can be tricky. These algorithms require a lot of practice and might be riskier than you'd like.
- [Juju ZBLL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uwmZHf4vwJxFgeB3-TiF8MQ0RFSS30d5CUK96PoIwk/): good algorithms that are used by a world-class ZBLL user. Sometimes there are better algorithms available.
- [ZBLL Explorer](https://pepkin88.me/zbll-explorer/): big selection of algorithms, better ranking than SpeedCubeDB's, shows the relation between cases

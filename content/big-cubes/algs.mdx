# More Ergonomic Algorithms
On big cubes, algorithms with S-moves might be a problem. Since S-moves are the reason EO is so efficient, using only RUF algorithms makes the average movecount almost 3 moves higher. Especially for the cases where the DR edge is misoriented, it is recommended to do the S-move algorithms, even on 7x7. That said, some of the other cases are not too bad using only RUF. The RUF EO algorithms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fjuIZvBnhMOp90Ify5DWr_Yh3YS0ewuukODGb16kSoA/edit?usp=sharing). 

For LXS, it is recommended to avoid using algorithms with D-, and S-moves. You can choose alternative solutions in the [regular LXS sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/).

# How to solve the 2x2x3
<Callout type="info">
    For simplicity purposes, this tutorial will explain the method using white on the bottom face, even though at a higher level, solvers should be able to solve with either white or yellow on the bottom.

## Introduction

The first step of the APB method is building a 2x2x3 block on the bottom-left side of the cube. This can be achieved through various ways and it is ultimately up to the solver to decide on which option to choose for a particular scramble. Since this is by far the step with the most freedom, there are a lot of techniques required to consistently achieve a good movecount. Below I will show some of the most useful and consistent methods of creating the 2x2x3.

    Unlike in regular Petrus, the 2x2x3 in APB is always solved on the bottom-left.

## 1x2x3 â†’ 2x2x3

First creating a Roux-style 1x2x3 block and then adding the DF and DB edges is probably the most consistent way of solving the 2x2x3. On most scrambles, this way of making your 2x2x3 leads to an efficient solution.

### Creating the 1x2x3
Like with the whole 2x2x3, the 1x2x3 can also be created through various techniques. To figure out new techniques, it is recommended you experiment a little on your own as well. Below are some possible methods to create the 1x2x3.

        It is possible to create the 1x2x3 using an F2L-style approach by first solving the DL edge and then creating and inserting the two left F2L pairs. It can sometimes be a bit hard to find efficient solutions using this method, so you should always be able to solve with other techniques as well.

        A 1x2x3-block can also be created using two 1x1x3 lines. These can be made in any order. If the scramble allows for it or even comes with a line pre-built, this method can lead to very efficient solutions.

# How to solve the 2x2x3
<Callout type="info">
    For simplicity purposes, this tutorial will explain the method using white on the bottom face, even though at a higher level, solvers should be able to solve with either white or yellow on the bottom.

## Introduction

The first step of the APB method is building a 2x2x3 block on the bottom-left side of the cube. This can be achieved through various ways and it is ultimately up to the solver to decide on which option to choose for a particular scramble. Since this is by far the step with the most freedom, there are a lot of techniques required to consistently achieve a good movecount. Below I will show some of the most useful and consistent methods of creating the 2x2x3.

    Unlike in regular Petrus, the 2x2x3 in APB is always solved on the bottom-left.

## 1x2x3 â†’ 2x2x3

First creating a Roux-style 1x2x3 block and then adding the DF and DB pieces is probably the most consistent way of solving the 2x2x3. It involves solving a 1x2x3 block on the left side.

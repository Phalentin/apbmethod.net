# 3. Solving the Last Layer
The final step of APB is the last layer. Solvers can use two main strategies here:

## OCLL + PLL
First solving OCLL and then PLL is definitely the easiest option. It requires 28 algorithms, although most CFOP solvers will already have learned these.

### 1. OCLL
OCLL are the OLL algorithms where the cross is already solved. They solve the orientation of the U-layer corners. They can be found [here](https://speedcubedb.com/a/3x3/OLL) (Make sure you select *OCLL* at the top).

### 2. PLL
PLL permutes the last layer pieces. The algorithms can be found [here](https://speedcubedb.com/a/3x3/PLL).

## ZBLL
At a higher level, ZBLL can be used to solve the last layer in one step. Further information on ZBLL can be found [here](/advanced/zbll).

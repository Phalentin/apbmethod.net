# 3. Orienting the Remaining Edges
Edge orientation is the third step of APB. In this step, you orient all the unsolved edges to reduce the number of following LXS cases and allow for advanced last layer techniques like ZBLL.

## What is Edge Orientation?

Edge orientation is the way an edge is twisted on the cube. Orienting an edge makes it solvable using only R and U moves.

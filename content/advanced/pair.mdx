# Solving the BR Pair Algorithmically
After you have got comfortable with all the algorithms of APB, you should start learning the optimal solutions for solving the back-right pair. This is especially important for the cases where the edge is misoriented.

The algorithms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1nwq_-HLeDgajuAOVRaH2Jo7X9zSTEBrnIRSv3hzeg/edit?gid=983211243#gid=983211243).

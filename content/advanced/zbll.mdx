# Advanced Last Layer (ZBLL)
If you have gotten comfortable with APB and have already learned full LXS, you should really start thinking about learning ZBLL. **APB was developed with ZBLL in mind** and it is really only competitive at a high level if you know ZBLL.

ZBLL solves the whole **last layer in one step**. Because in APB, the edges are all oriented, the number of algorithms for this step is "only" 493. 21 of those are the PLL cases which you probably already know. ZBLL is divided into eight subsets, corresponding to the cross solved OLL cases and PLL: U, T, L, Pi, H, Sune, Antisune and PLL. These subsets all consist of 72 algorithms, except for H (48) and PLL (21). The recommended order for learning ZBLL is the following:

0. PLL
1. U, T and L
2. Pi and H
3. Sune and Antisune

## How to Approach Learning ZBLL
It is recommended, to set yourself a goal of **N cases per M days**. A reasonable example would be twelve cases (a sub-subset) per week. However, you should not set a goal like one case per day. It is better to learn multiple cases on the same day and then use the following days for their repetition. To train your cases, you can use [bestsiteever.net/zbll](https://bestsiteever.net/zbll) and select the cases you are learning right now.

## Algorithm Sources
There are multiple sites where you can find ZBLL algorithms. Some of them are listed below:
- [SpeedCubeDB ZBLL](https://speedcubedb.com/a/ZBLL): big selection of algorithms, but the top algorithm is often not the best one
- [Teri's ZBLL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BiQZkCZvTDRlW6Y6jTBHXPPjZF9k55x8YJgXXs5nhCs/): really optimised algorithms, but getting the right fingertricks can be tricky. These algorithms require a lot of practice and might be riskier than you'd like.
- [Juju ZBLL](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-uwmZHf4vwJxFgeB3-TiF8MQ0RFSS30d5CUK96PoIwk/): good algorithms that are used by a world-class ZBLL user. Sometimes there are better algorithms available.
- [ZBLL Explorer](https://pepkin88.me/zbll-explorer/): big selection of algorithms, better ranking than SpeedCubeDB's, shows the relation between cases
